## Regex Components

### Anchors
This expression does not include anchors. The zip code can be found in any place within a string for it to be accepted.
If you'd like to only accept zip codes at the beginning or end of a string, you could add a ^ or $ to the expression.

### Quantifiers
This expression includes two quantifiers. These look for 5 digits in a row, and 4 digits in a row. These are shown with {5} and {4}.
